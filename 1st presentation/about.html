<h2 class="center" style="font-size: 55px;">History and Overview</h2>

<p style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 30px">Lamborghini, officially Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A., is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer known for high-performance, exotic supercars. The company was founded in 1963 by Ferruccio Lamborghini in Sant’Agata Bolognese, Italy.

Ferruccio initially made tractors and wanted to compete with Ferrari, which he felt could be improved upon. Lamborghini quickly became famous for producing cars with extreme performance, cutting-edge design, and luxurious interiors.</p>
